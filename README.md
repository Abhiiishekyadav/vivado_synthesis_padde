This repository contains a Vitis-HLS-based C++ implementation of basic MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) blocks, utilizing various compiler directives such as pragmas. The repository includes the following files:

1. **mlp1.cpp**: Basic C++ implementation of a feed-forward ANN (Artificial Neural Network) with a sigmoid-based activation function.
   The test bench is provided in `MLP_tb.cpp`, and additional files `datapack.h` and `mlp.h` contain information about weights and other parameters.
   
2. **padde.cpp**: Implements a Pade-based approximation of an ANN block.
    The corresponding header file is `padde.h`, while `mnist.h` includes MNIST dataset weights and activation functions. All pragma directives are detailed in `pragma.cpp`.

3. **Pade** repository consist of cpp implementation of various floating point, PEs block, full architecture etc.
